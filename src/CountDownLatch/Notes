public class CountDownLatch
extends Object
A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a 
set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

A CountDownLatch is initialized with a given count. The await methods block 
until the current count reaches zero due to invocations of the countDown() 
method, after which all waiting threads are released and any subsequent 
invocations of await return immediately. This is a one-shot phenomenon -- 
the count cannot be reset. If you need a version that resets the count, 
consider using a CyclicBarrier.

A CountDownLatch is a versatile synchronization tool and can be used for
a number of purposes. A CountDownLatch initialized with a count of one 
serves as a simple on/off latch, or gate: all threads invoking await 
wait at the gate until it is opened by a thread invoking countDown(). 
A CountDownLatch initialized to N can be used to make one thread wait 
until N threads have completed some action, or some action has been completed N times.

A useful property of a CountDownLatch is that it doesn't 
require that threads calling countDown wait for the count 
to reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any thread 
from proceeding past an await until all threads could pass.
